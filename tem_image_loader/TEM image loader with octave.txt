MIRROR CONTROL
==============

To control the mirror within Octave/MATLAB, start it like this:

	proc_id = popen('tem_image_loader.exe', 'w');

This will activate the image loader program in a mode that waits
for file names of bitmap (.bmp) images to be sent to it. The proc_id
variable stores the process ID needed for the later commands.

To send an image file name to the program, use this command:

	fputs(proc_id, [full_path_to_file_name "\n"]);

The newline character (double-quoted "\n" in Octave,
single-quoted '\n' in MATLAB) at the end is mandatory.

The full_path_to_file_name should include the full directory to the file, 
i.e., C:\dir1\dir2\pic.bmp.



In the example tem_script.m, the uigetfile() function returns the file name
and path as separate variables.

	[dmd_files, dmd_path, ~] = uigetfile('*.bmp', 'Window Title', 'MultiSelect', 'on');

'*.bmp' filters for bitmap files
'MultiSelect', 'on' allows for multiple files to be selected.

To create a full path to a file, concatenate the path and file name.

	full_path = [dmd_path dmd_file{index}] % Curly brackets since the file list is a cell
										   % array




tem_image_loader.exe Stand-Alone Operation:

If you just want to put an image on the mirror from the command line,
just run tem_image_loader.exe followed by a list of images.

	tem_image_loader.exe image1.bmp image2.bmp ...

Pressing enter will iterate through the images and quit after the last one.

If tem_image_loader.exe is started without any arguments, it waits for
file names to be sent to it on stdin. Press 



CAMERA CONTROL
==============

The camera can also be used within Octave/MATLAB. Use the system() command to
activate it. For example,

	system('tem_image_acquisition.exe --exposure 500 --filename picture.png');

The argument to the system command is a command-line invocation of the program.

The options for the tem_image_acquisition.exe program are
	--exposure <number> - sets the exposure to <number> milliseconds
	--gain <number> - sets the gain to <number> (valid range: [0, 100]; default: 0)
	--filename <text> - saves the image (PNG only) to the given file name

The picture file will be placed in the same directory as the running script unless a 
full path is given.

For now, the capture program only saves .png picture files. This can be changed if needed.



For standalone operation, the command is the same except for the system function:

	tem_image_acquisition.exe --exposure 500 --filename picture.png
